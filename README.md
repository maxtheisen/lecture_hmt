# lecture_hmt

This repository contains two jupyter notebooks for the lecture on transport phenomena. 

Please open the file named TransportPhenomenaLab.ipynb first. It contains the interactive assigment. To gain a deeper understanding of the contents shown in the lecture with more examples, look at TransportPhenomenaLab-Addition.ipynb. 

## This notebook is designed for the lecture on transport phenomena 

__As you will see, this notebook consists of four parts:__
- Real data for comparison
- A finite-differences implementation to solve the Partial Differential Equation (PDE)
- A cell to define the thermal diffusivity $\alpha$
- A comparison between real values and calculated ones

__First, choose a value for the thermal diffusivity, here called $\alpha$, for Section 2. Then, run all Sections 0 to 4 to get a result. If you want to change the parameter alpha afterwards, rerun Section 2-4 after changing alpha__

You can run the cells either by clicking on the cell and then on Run or press ctrl+enter
